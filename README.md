Clone or fork the whole project

To run locally, open first the whole project in ide. Then in terminal, go to client folder and run 
npm install

To run the client, type
ng serve

And press enter.

If this fails, you havenâ€™t installed the angular cli yet,
To install it, run
npm install -g @angular/cli
And run ng serve again.

Then, open a new terminal window in your ide and go into server folder (cd ../server) and run npm install again

In order for the backend to run properly locally you need a .env file with environment vars for the following:

googleClientID=
googleClientSecret=
twitterConsumerKey=
twitterConsumerSecret=
mongoURI=
cookieKey=
twitterCallbackUrl=http://localhost:4200/api/auth/twitter/callback

[In prod you replace these env vars with environment vars on the server]

To run the server, type
nodemon
In your terminal and press enter, voila! Front and backend are running now

The db runs directly on mongodb atlas, https://cloud.mongodb.com/
